## 💭 The Koaplinchik Manifesto

> *“Most people wait too long to capture the moment…  
> until the baby’s grown, the laughter fades,  
> or the love is no longer new.  
> **We won’t let that happen.**”*

## 🚫 What Kills the Magic (Avoid at All Costs)

* Generic developer phrases like “clean design” — speak poetry.
* Stock photos or lorem ipsum — authenticity or nothing.
* CTAs without heart — every button is an invitation, not a command.
* Speed without soul — fast but forgettable is failure.

If it doesn’t make your chest feel warm or your fingers pause before clicking, delete it and try again.

## 💌 Final Thought

You’re not just building a website.  
You’re crafting a memory machine where people will pause, smile, and whisper,  
*“I want this for us.”*

Make every line of code a love letter.  
Ship with heart, always. 💕
